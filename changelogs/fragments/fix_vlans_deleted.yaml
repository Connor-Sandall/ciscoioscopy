bugfixes:
  - ios_vlans - Fixed an issue in the `cisco.ios.ios_vlans` module on Cisco Catalyst 9000 switches where using state:purged generated an incorrect command syntax (`no vlan configuration <vlan_id>` instead of `no vlan <vlan_id>`).
  - ios_vlans - Resolved a failure in the `cisco.ios.ios_vlans` module when using state:deleted, where the module incorrectly attempted to remove VLANs using `no mtu <value>`, causing an invalid input error. The fix ensures that the module does not generate `no mtu` commands during VLAN deletion, aligning with the correct VLAN removal behavior on Catalyst 9000 switches.
  - ios_vlans - Defaut mtu would be captured (1500) and no configuration for mtu is allowed via ios_vlans module.
deprecated_features:
  - ios_vlans - deprecate mtu, please use ios_interfaces to configure mtu to the interface where vlans is applied.
