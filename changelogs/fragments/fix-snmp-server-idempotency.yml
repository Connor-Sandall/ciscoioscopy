bugfixes:
  - Fixed idempotency issue in SNMP configuration management. Replaced in-place modifications of `i_have` with key tracking using a set. This change preserves the original `i_have` during iteration, ensuring consistent and accurate updates by only negating the remaining keys and preventing unintended overwrites.
